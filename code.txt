**Author/Requester:** [User's Name/Alias, if known, otherwise "Project Lead"]
**Stakeholders:** End Users, Development Team

## 1. Introduction & Overview

The "Video Utility Suite" (codename: VidMate Pro / VideoSwissKnife - *placeholder*) is a web-based application designed to provide users with a comprehensive set of tools for manipulating online videos and playlists. It aims to offer a modern, sleek, intuitive, and free-to-use interface for common tasks such as downloading, audio extraction, transcription, translation, and various video/audio editing functions. The application will leverage existing free command-line interface (CLI) tools and APIs, orchestrated by a backend, and presented through a user-friendly frontend.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

*   **Provide a Centralized Hub:** Offer a single platform for multiple common video/audio processing tasks, eliminating the need for users to find and use separate tools.
*   **User-Friendly Experience:** Design an intuitive, modern, and aesthetically pleasing interface (dark theme, gradients) that is easy for both technical and non-technical users to navigate.
*   **Leverage Free Resources:** Build upon robust, free, and open-source tools and APIs to keep the service accessible.
*   **Efficiency:** Streamline common workflows for video and audio manipulation.
*   **Accessibility:** Enable users to easily access and repurpose video content in various formats (text, audio).

## 3. Target Audience

*   **Content Creators:** Needing to repurpose video content, extract audio for podcasts, generate transcripts, or create short clips/GIFs.
*   **Students & Researchers:** Requiring transcripts for lectures or interviews, or needing to download educational content.
*   **Language Learners:** Using transcription and translation features to aid in language study.
*   **General Users:** Anyone needing to download online videos for offline viewing, extract audio, or perform simple video edits.

        *   OpenAI Whisper (local execution via Python script).
        *   Vosk API (offline, open-source).
        *   (Potentially free tiers of cloud services, with limitations).
    *   **Translation:**
        *   LibreTranslate API (self-hosted or public instances).
        *   Argos Translate (Python library for offline translation).
        *   (Potentially free tiers of cloud services, with limitations).

## 7. UI/UX Design Principles

*   **Modern & Sleek:** Clean lines, contemporary feel.
*   **Intuitive:** Easy to understand workflow, clear labeling, logical grouping of functions.
*   **Responsive:** Usable across various screen sizes (desktop-first focus initially).
*   **Dark Theme:** Default or easily switchable dark mode for user comfort.
*   **Gradient Colors:** Judicious use of gradients for visual appeal in backgrounds or accents.
*   **Component-Based:** Utilize Shadcn/ui components (Buttons, Inputs, Cards, Progress bars, Selects, Tabs, Labels) for consistency and accessibility.
*   **Layout:**
    *   Main input area for URL/file.
    *   Options panel (possibly using Tabs for different action groups).
    *   Clear action buttons.
    *   Dedicated progress/status display area.
    *   Organized results display area.
*   **Feedback:** Provide clear visual feedback for user actions, loading states, progress, and errors.

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**
    *   Responsive UI.
    *   Efficient backend processing; long operations should not block UI.
    *   Clear progress indication for time-consuming tasks.
*   **Usability:** As defined in UI/UX Design Principles.
*   **Security:**
    *   Sanitization of all user inputs (especially URLs and file paths) to prevent command injection.
    *   Protection of any API keys (stored on backend, not exposed to frontend).
    *   Secure file handling and temporary storage.
*   **Reliability & Error Handling:**
    *   Graceful handling of errors from external CLIs/APIs.
    *   Clear error messages to the user.
    *   Robust backend processing.
*   **Scalability (Basic):** Backend should be able to handle a moderate number of concurrent requests (initial focus on single-user experience per session).
*   **Maintainability:** Well-structured, modular code on both frontend and backend.

## 9. Future Considerations / Roadmap (Post-MVP)

*   **Batch Processing:** Allow users to queue multiple URLs or tasks.
*   **Advanced Queue System:** Robust job queue for managing backend tasks.
*   **User Accounts:** For saving preferences, history of operations, or processed files.
*   **Direct Cloud Storage Integration:** Allow saving results to user's cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox).
*   **Expanded Format Support:** Continuously add support for more video/audio formats and codecs.
*   **More Advanced Editing Features:** Basic color correction, audio mixing, etc. (if feasible with CLI tools).
*   **Plugin System/Extensibility:** Allow for easier addition of new tools or features.

## 10. Assumptions

*   Users have the legal right to download and process the content they provide via URLs.
*   The free CLI tools (`yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg`) and APIs (Whisper, LibreTranslate) will remain available and functional.
*   Users will have a reasonably modern web browser.
*   The backend server will have sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, disk space) for processing tasks.

## 11. Open Questions & Risks

*   **API Rate Limits:** Public instances of APIs (e.g., LibreTranslate) may have strict rate limits. Self-hosting or alternative solutions might be necessary.
*   **Complexity of `ffmpeg` Commands:** Generating robust and correct `ffmpeg` commands for all desired features and edge cases can be complex.
*   **File Management & Cleanup:** Strategy for managing temporary and output files, especially for concurrent users or long-term storage, needs careful planning.
*   **Resource Intensity:** Video processing is resource-intensive. Performance on shared hosting or low-spec servers might be a concern.
*   **Keeping Dependencies Updated:** `yt-dlp` in particular requires frequent updates to keep working with sites like YouTube.
*   **Error Propagation & Debugging:** Tracing errors through multiple layers (Frontend -> Backend -> CLI -> External API) can be challenging.

## 12. Success Metrics (Examples)

*   Number of unique users / sessions.
*   Number of videos/audio files processed successfully per feature.
*   Task completion rate.
*   User feedback and satisfaction scores (if a feedback mechanism is implemented).
*   Average processing time for common tasks.
